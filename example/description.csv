"DSC01604.JPG","""A low-angle, full shot of the Science Centre Singapore. \n\n\nThe building's exterior is a muted gray, with petal-like, curved sections that form a large, flower-like shape. Visible portions of translucent or glass sections are present within some of these curved segments, appearing  purple or bluish-purple from the angle of the shot. \n\n\nThe sky is a clear, light-blue color, and a small portion of a leafy tree is visible in the bottom left of the image. Other modern buildings, some with vertical lines, are also partially visible on the left side of the central structure. \n\n\nThe overall impression is of a large, distinctive modern architectural design against a clear sky."""
"DSC01712.JPG","""A wide shot of a section of the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, likely evening or twilight. \n\n\nThe foreground features a walkway next to a canal or waterway, with a low concrete barrier and metal railings. \n\n\nThe middle ground shows lush landscaping, including various trees and shrubs, with a covered walkway or seating area supported by light-colored metal structures. \n\n\nThe background displays the iconic curved, multi-level structure of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, with its distinct high-rise sections and a bridge-like design. The buildings are modern, light gray-toned, and feature many windows. \n\n\nThe sky is a pale, light blue color. Soft lighting is visible, likely from the buildings and/or the covered walkways. People are visible on the walkway."""
"IMG_6343.JPG","""High-angle close-up view of a meal on a light-colored, speckled table. \n\n\nThe meal consists of three dishes:\n\n\n1.  A bowl of light-green soup with indistinct white pieces, likely dumplings or similar ingredients.\n\n\n2.  A bowl of vegetables, likely stir-fried or sautéed, with light-brown pieces and green leafy vegetables.\n\n\n3.  A bowl of white rice topped with a medley of fried or stir-fried items (possibly seafood, chicken, or vegetables). The food appears to have a light-brown to dark-brown color and is mixed with other ingredients, possibly including a light-green vegetable.\n\n\nThe bowls rest on a light-brown wooden surface or tray with a patterned metal frame underneath.  A menu or paper is partially visible on the table on the left side of the image. A blurred background suggests a restaurant setting."""
